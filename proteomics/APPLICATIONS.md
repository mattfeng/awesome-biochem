# Applications of Quantitative Proteomics and Posttranslational Modification Analysis in Biology 

* Precise measurement of proteins, their modifications, and their interactions is an essential complement to genomics
    * Understanding cell circuitry and signalling â†’ understand disease biology
    * Connect genes to physiology
    * Define targets and mechanism of action of drugs
    * High throughput quantitative biology
