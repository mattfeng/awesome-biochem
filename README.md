    * What information do they encode? Why are they useful?
* Biological structure and function emerge from scaling unsupervised learning to 250 million protein sequences
    * How can we continue to extend Transformer and related NLP architectures to biological sequences? Are there even more pre-training tasks we can use?

#### 🌌 Protein folding
* Topological determinants of protein folding
    * What is the right mathematical model to use to develop theory about protein folding?
