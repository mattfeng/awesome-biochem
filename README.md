## Questions

* Linked de Bruijn graphs (LdBG)
    * What information do they encode? Why are they useful for bioinformatics?
* Why is the number of distinct de Bruijn sequences B(k, n) equal to (k!)^(k^(n-1)) / (k^n)?
* How can we continue to extend Transformer and related NLP architectures to biological sequences? Are there even more pre-training tasks we can use?
* Topological determinants of protein folding
    * What is the right mathematical model to use to develop theory about protein folding?
