## What would it mean to be successful?

* The ultimate goal of computer-aided drug design is the ability to predict how strongly a potential drug candidate will bind to a protein target (i.e. the compound's binding affinity).
    * Such capability would allow us accelerate drug development, focusing in only on compounds with high predicted binding affinity (and low affinity to off-target proteins).
    * Generally require predictions to be within 1 kcal/mol to be useful (order of magnitude in binding affinity).

## Where do we currently stand?
* FEP calculations are still sensitive to protein conformation employed (and the xray structure chosen).
