# 2.3 Force Field Parameters

* An arbitrary constant whose value characterizes an element of an system.

## Where to get parameters?
* Structures (crystals, electron density maps)
* Spectra (IR, NMR)
* More complex simulations (potential energy surfaces)

## Desired properties
* General (apply to any kind of molecule)
* Transferable (usable for similar molecules)
* Accurate (will result in accurate answer)
