# 2.2 Molecular Mechanics

## Definition
* A set of models using **empirical, algebraic, atomistic** (per atom) energy functions for chemical systems.

## Energy calculations
Etotal = Ebonded + Enonbonded
Ebonded = Ebnods + Eangles + Etorsions
Enonbonded = Eelectrostatic + Evanderwaals

## Modeling
* Atoms are represented as 3-d point particles, and are the lowest level of detail in the model
* Describe the structure with bonds, angles, and torsions

## Examples
* **AMBER, CHARMM.** used for nucleic acids and proteins
* **OPLS.** smaller organic molecules

## Limitations
* Up to millions of atoms.
* Up to trillions of configurations.
* Accuracy of energy function is lower.
* Very limited scope for the parameters.
