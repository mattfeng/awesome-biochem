# Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM) Molecular Simulation Method

* Attempts to reconcile the best of two approaches:
    * **QM (accuracy).** Between O(N<sup>2.5</sup>) and O(N<sup>3</sup>) (N is the _number of basis functions_, not the number of atoms; each atom has at least <i>b</i> basis functions, where <i>b</i> is the number of electrons).
    * **MM (speed).** Between O(N) and O(N<sup>2</sup>)
