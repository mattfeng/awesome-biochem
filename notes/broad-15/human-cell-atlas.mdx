* Cells express the genes they need at the right quantities
* Gene expression profiles are "calling cards" of cells
* Knowing gene expression profiles is essential to understanding disease (where does it affect?)
* Cells are data points on a plot, where the axes are genes (coordinates are level of expression)
    * Requires **single cell genomics**
* New technology: single cell genomics and spatial genomics
* Single cell genomics
    * reveals new kinds of cells
    * reveals order of development
    * identifies programs used by cells - what confers resistance to therapies?
    * elucidates the basis and treatment of complex genetic disease
