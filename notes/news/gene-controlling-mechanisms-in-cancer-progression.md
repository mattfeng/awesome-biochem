# Gene-controlling mechanisms play key role in cancer progression ([http](https://news.mit.edu/2020/tumor-epigenomic-cancer-progression-0723))

* Chromatin passes through (around) 11 different states as lung cancer (in mouse models) progresses.
* Transcription factors tended to target genes that _would help the cells lose their original identity as lung cells and become less differentiated_. This led to many of the cells gaining the ability to leave their original locations and seed new tumors (i.e. metastasize).
* Primary transcription factor: **RUNX2**.
