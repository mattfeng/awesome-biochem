# Michael Bronstein, Geometric deep learning

* Two prototypical objects
    * Graphs
    * Surfaces

* How to represent geometric shapes?
    * Volumetric
    * Point cloud
    * Surface/mesh

* Intrinsic vs. extrinsic convolution
    * Intrinsic convolution molds to the surface

* Geodesic polar coordinates (MoNet)
* Protein design = "inverse" folding
* Molecular surface is a better model of itneraction interfaces
* Surfaces are also deformable


* What's next
    * Bound vs. unbound proteins
    * **Experimental validation** (infrastructure for this?)
    * Incorporating ligand description
    * End-to-end generative models
    * Protein-protein interaction networks
    * Other biomolecules (e.g. DNA)
