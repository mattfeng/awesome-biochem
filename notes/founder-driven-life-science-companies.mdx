## Bulletpoints
* Founder-driven life science companies only make sense if the company is scalable like a SaaS.
* Firms that focus on _unique business models_ led by gerat inventors and founders will make founder-driven life sciences investing work out financially.
* The pioneering company of the life sciences industry in the 1970s and 1980s (driven by discovery of DNA's structure and the central dogma) was Genentech, who was able to produce and sell **human insulin** (via recombinant technology).
* Life science returns compressed in the 1990s due a variety of factors:
  1. Regulatory &ndash; FDA became more conservative in new modalities.
  2. Healthcare incentives &ndash; spending on healthcare was slowing down.
  3. Productivity &ndash; newer drugs were getting more difficult to find.
  4. Breakthroughs not working out &ndash; new inventions from genomics failed to improve productivity.
  5. IPOs/M&A &ndash; overall liquidity in life sciences market disappeared.
* As such, most capital in life sciences preferred experienced CEOs with high investor ownership.
* Phase II success rates have been steadily increasing since 2012, due to a combination of:
  * breakthrough science
  * a more lenient FDA
  * use of biomarkers to stratify populations at higher resolution
