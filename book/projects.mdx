The life sciences has seen a boon in the number of collaborative projects aimed at generating high quality datasets for analysis. These projects are generally well organized, however, they suffer from one flaw: there is no central location introducing each of the projects, making it difficult for new researchers to utilize these datasets to their fullest extent. This living document aims to offer introductions and guides to these projects, to further exposure and understanding of these datasets.

## How to use this document
Each project is first introduced, describing the data gathered and historical use cases for such data. Then, more details on the project are described, such as the motivations and history, successes and shortcomings, the current status of the project, and related or successor projects.
