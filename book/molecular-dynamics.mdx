## _Molecular dynamics simulations: advances and applications_[^1]

### Strategies to improve ensemble generation
* Most simulations explore only a small region about the energy minimum closest to the initial configuration.
* Markov state model theory has been used to reconstruct global behavior of multiple parallel simulations.
* [[Metadynamics]]
* [[Simulated annealing]] has been gradually replaced by [[replica exchange methods]].

### Setting up MD simulations
* Standard procedure:
    1. Fixing structure errors
    2. Ionization of titrable amino acids
    3. Addition of structural water molecules, counter ions, and solvent
    4. Energy minimization and equilibration of system at desired temperature

### Applications
#### Understanding allostery
* ?

#### Molecular docking and drug design
* Molecular recognition process is dynamic, but _current tools assume a rigid structure_.
* It is possible to introduce flexibility a posteriori.
* It is still not clear whether structural adjustment comes from the selection of available conformations or is induced by the binding process itself.
* [[Ensemble docking]] usually uses selection of representative snapshots from a simulation as targets in normal docking procedures.

#### Refining structure predictions
* Template-based modeling is still the most efficient technique.
* Starting a single simulation from the predicted structure does not work; using an ensemble works better.
