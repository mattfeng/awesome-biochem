* **accessible surface area (solvent-accessible surface area).** the surface area of a biomolecule that is accessible to a solvent. typically measured in square angstroms.

* **amine.**

* **_apo_ structure.** the structure of an unbound protein. compare with **_holo_ structure**.

* **chromatin.** the material of which the **chromosomes** of organisms other than bacteria are composed. It consists of protein, RNA, and DNA.

* **chimeric protein.**

* **congeneric.**

* **contig.**

* **covalent radius.**

* **distribution coefficient (D).**

* **ectopic.**

* **epigenomics states.** structural configurations of **chromatin**.

* **geminal.** denoting substitutent groups or atoms that are attached to the same atom in a molecule (comes from the Latin word _gemini_, meaning &ldquo;twins&rdquo;).

* **genetic polymorphism.**

* **gene pool.**

* **half maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>).** the concentration of a drug, antibody, or toxicant which induces a response halfway between baseline and maximum after a specific exposure time. It is also denoted <Chem chem="\ce{[A]}_{50}" />, and accordingly is measured in molarity.

* **half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>).**

* **heteroatom.**

* **_holo_ structure.** the structure of a protein bound to a ligand.

* **imine.**

* **inihibitory constant (K<sub>i</sub>).** a lower value indicates a stronger binding affinity to the enzyme of interest (often the enzyme to inhibit).

* **karyotype.**

* **meso compound.**

* **messenger RNA (mRNA).**

* **miscible.** the property of two substances to _mix in all proportions_ (they fully dissolve each other at all concentrations), forming a homogeneous solution.

* **monooxygenase.** enzymes that incorporate one hydroxyl group into substrates.

* **motif.**

* **ncRNA.**

* **paralog.**

* **partition coefficient (P).**

* **portal vein (hepatic portal vein, HPV).**

* **profile matrix.** a matrix $P$ created from a set of $N$ equal-length strings where $P_{ij}$ represents the number of times symbol $s_i$ appears at position $j$.

* **protein domain.** a structural and functional unit of the protein.

* **pseudogene.**

* **rRNA.**

* **singlet.** in quantum mechanics, a **singlet** state refers to a system in which all electrons are paired.

* **snRNA.**

* **snoRNA.**

* **surface plasmon resonance (SPR).** 

* **transcription factor (TF).** a protein that controls the rate of transcription of genetic information from **DNA** to **mRNA** by binding to a specific DNA sequence.

* **transfer RNA (tRNA).**

* **unitig.**

* **variant calling.** comparing a sample sequence with a reference sequence to determine differences, including SNPs, indels, and large scale structural variants. ([source](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/glossary/variant-calling))

* **vincinal.**
