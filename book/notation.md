### Organic Chemistry

In a typical chemical reaction, **reactants** (also known as **substrates**) combine with **reagents**. These reactions occur under certain conditions, such as _solvent_, _temperature_, _heat_, or _light_. These conditions are often listed above or below the reaction arrow. _Reagents_ may be listed either to the left of the reaction arrow, or above/below it. Most often, the stoichiometry is not balanced.

If the reaction occurs in discrete steps, then sometimes the reagents and conditions are numbered, and listed above/below the reaction arrow.
